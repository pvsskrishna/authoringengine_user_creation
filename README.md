this error is coming when im selecting other than game admin while user creation

and one more issue:
when I am creating a user by selecting Cognito , inconsistently an error is coming about password . where it should not give that error because "when selecting Cognito ,password text filed is getting disappear" and I'm unable to create a user using automation when this error arrived.

but still for same credentials I'm able to create user using automation when by having only that specific data in excel

this is the scenario I came across
